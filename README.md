## Instruction for running the Project <br/>
Before the Run add your facebook user name and password in user.properties file in Property Folder and run the job from testng .XML <br/>

### About the Framework <br/>
I have Created a Maven Project and implemented Page Object Model and Page Factory desgin pattern.<br/>
Used TestNg to segregate the test cases and to provide data to the test cases I have used Data providers and parameter tag in testng.xml file. And to store the user name and password I used property file. <br/>
I have integrated them to the Extent Reports.
